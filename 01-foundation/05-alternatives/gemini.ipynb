      "### LLM as a Judge Overview\n",
      "**LLM as a judge** refers to using a Large Language Model to evaluate text outputs based on custom criteria. This approach is used for regression testing, prompt comparison, or production evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of LLM Evaluators\n",
      "According to the documentation, there are two primary ways to use an LLM as a judge:\n",
      "- **Reference-based**: Compares new responses against a \"ground truth\" or approved reference response. This is useful for regression testing.\n",
      "- **Open-ended**: Evaluates responses based on specific criteria (e.g., verbosity or conciseness) when no reference is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Process\n",
      "To create an LLM judge using the `evidently` library, you follow these steps:\n",
      "1. **Define a Dataset**: Create a dataset containing inputs (questions), target responses, and the new responses to be evaluated.\n",
      "2. **Design a Prompt Template**: Use classes like `BinaryClassificationPromptTemplate` to define the evaluation criteria (e.g., correctness or conciseness). These templates handle the classification and reasoning output automatically.\n",
      "3. **Add the LLM Descriptor**: Use `LLMEval` to apply the prompt to specific columns in your dataset.\n",
      "4. **Run a Report**: Generate an Evidently `Report` using `TextEvals()` to summarize the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluating the Judge\n",
      "Because an LLM judge is considered a small ML system, it requires its own evaluation to ensure quality:\n",
      "- **Manual Labels**: Compare the LLM's evaluations against manual \"ground truth\" labels.\n",
      "- **Classification Metrics**: Treat the judge's output as a classification problem. You can use the `ClassificationPreset()` in Evidently to calculate metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall** (to ensure the judge doesn't miss \"incorrect\" answers).\n",
      "- **Exact Match**: Use the `ExactMatch` descriptor to directly compare the LLM-judged label against manual labels.\n"
