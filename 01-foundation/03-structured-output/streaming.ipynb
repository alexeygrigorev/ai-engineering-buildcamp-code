      "Once upon a time in a land not so far away, there was a unicorn named Nimbus. Nimbus was not your typical majestic creature; instead of a shimmering coat and a sparkling horn, his fur was a dull gray, and his horn was crooked. While other unicorns danced in meadows and spread joy, Nimbus often felt left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, Nimbus decided to go on an adventure to find the legendary Rainbow Falls, a place said to grant wishes. He hoped that maybe, just maybe, it could transform him into the unicorn he always dreamed of being. So, with determination in his heart and a sad little hope in his eyes, he set off.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he traveled, Nimbus encountered various obstacles. He stumbled over rocks that other unicorns would have gracefully danced around. He got caught in thorn bushes when trying to take shortcuts. Each misstep seemed to reinforce the idea that he would never belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a long and exhausting journey filled with mishaps, Nimbus finally found the Rainbow Falls. The water sparkled with colors like he had never seen. Eagerly, he made a wish to be beautiful and graceful like the others. As he closed his eyes and imagined his transformation, he heard a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,\" the voice said. Nimbus opened his eyes to see a wise old owl perched nearby. \"What you seek lies not in your appearance but within your heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Confused and a little disappointed, Nimbus thanked the owl and decided to drink from the falls anyway. But instead of magic, he felt only the cool water touch his lips and trickle down. Feeling disheartened, he turned to leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he walked back toward home, he noticed something unusual: every time he stumbled, creatures of the forest rushed to help him. He realized that while he may not have fit the mold of the perfect unicorn, he had something else—kindness. The more he helped others with their problems, the more comfortable he felt with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally home, Nimbus reflected on his journey. He would never be like the other unicorns, but he had learned that true greatness lies in being true to oneself. A few days later, while helping a lost rabbit find its way, Nimbus discovered the real magic in his heart: friendship and kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And even if Nimbus never looked like a typical unicorn, he learned that being a one-of-a-kind friend was much more important.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the next time you see a unicorn, remember that it’s not all about the sparkles and grace—sometimes, it’s about the heart. And though Nimbus didn’t get his wish, he found something better. \n",
      "\n",

      "## Once Upon a Time\n",
      "\n",
      "In a hidden valley, far away from the chaos of the world, lived a majestic unicorn named Liora. With a shimmering mane that sparkled under the moonlight and a horn that glowed with the colors of a rainbow, she was the last of her kind. But Liora's beauty came with a heavy burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Price of Greatness\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike others of her kin, Liora had been cursed by a jealous sorceress who feared the magic of unicorns. The curse silenced her voice and stripped her of the ability to heal. No longer could she sing to the forest or bring forth the blooming flowers in spring. The once vibrant valley began to wither and fade, mirroring Liora's own sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Searching for Hope\n",
      "\n",
      "Determined to break the curse, Liora embarked on a quest to find the witch who had cast it upon her. She crossed treacherous mountains, faced fearsome creatures, and even navigated through dark, enchanted forests. But the more she journeyed, the more she realized that her hope was dwindling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Final Confrontation\n",
      "\n",
      "After many moons of searching, Liora finally found the sorceress in a hidden cave. With her heart pounding and tears in her eyes, Liora approached the witch, who cackled at her misery. 'You think you can take back your magic?' the witch taunted. Courageously, Liora shook her head, tears flowing down her face as she shone her light in the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "## A Heavy Decision\n",
      "\n",
      "In that moment, the sorceress revealed the truth: the only way to regain her voice was to give away her magic forever. Torn between her desire to speak and the love she felt for her valley and its creatures, Liora realized that her true strength lay not in her words, but in her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Cost of Silence\n",
      "\n",
      "She chose to let go of her magic, breaking the curse. Liora's voice returned, but the glow of her horn faded. The valley began to bloom again, but Liora always felt a void within her. Though she could now sing, each note reminded her of what she had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Legacy of the Unicorn\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Liora lived many more years, she never regained her magical glow. Yet, she spent her days teaching the creatures of the valley about kindness, love, and the importance of selflessness. The valley flourished, filled with life and laughter once more, but the tale of Liora’s sacrifice echoed through generations, a bittersweet reminder of the magic that once was."

      "\n",
      "- **Create an Evaluation Dataset**: You'll need a dataset containing questions, target responses, new responses for evaluation, and manual labels indicating the correctness of responses.\n",
      "- **Run the LLM Evaluator**: Develop a prompt for the LLM to evaluate the text response. You can set up prompts for different evaluation focuses, such as correctness or verbosity.\n",
      "- **Evaluate the LLM Judge**: After the LLM evaluates the responses, you should compare the evaluations against manual labels to assess the quality of the LLM's judgments.\n",
