      "- **Steps to Add a Tab:**\n",
      "  1. Enter \"Edit\" mode on the dashboard.\n",
      "  2. Click the plus sign to add a new tab.\n",
      "  3. Optionally create a custom tab by selecting \"empty\" and entering a name.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pre-built Tabs:** You can start with dashboard templates that come with preset panel combinations, relevant to specific metrics. However, panels will remain empty until appropriate reports are added.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Adding Panels**\n",
      "- **Purpose:** Panels visualize evaluation results or metrics over time.\n",
      "- **Steps to Add a Panel:**\n",
      "  1. Enter \"Edit\" mode.\n",
      "  2. Click the \"Add Panel\" button.\n",
      "  3. Choose metrics, set filters by tags and metric labels, and select the panel type.\n",

You can use it:\\\\n\\\\n- to track evaluation results across multiple experiments;\\\\n- to track live production quality over time.\\\\n\\\\nEach Project has its own Dashboard. It\\'s empty at first.\\\\n\\\\nTo populate it, you need to run an evaluation and **save at least one Report** to the Project.

Panels can be counters, line plots, bar plots, etc. You can add multiple Panels to the Dashboard and customize their type and values shown.\\\\n\\\\nYou can add Panels in two ways:\\\\n- Using the Python API \\\\u2013 define your Dashboard as code.\\\\n- Through the UI \\\\u2013 add Panels directly from the interface (Cloud and Enterprise only).\\\\n  \\\\nTo create a Panel, you need to specify:\\\\n- Value \\\\u2013 choose an individual metric to plot.\\\\n- Parameters \\\\u2013 such as title, panel type, and size.\\\\n- Tags (optional) \\\\u2013 use to filter and visualize subsets of your data.\\\\n\\\\n## From Dashboard to Reports\\\\n\\\\nBy clicking on any individual value on the Dashboard, you can open the associated Report and source Dataset for further debugging.\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/dashboard/dashboard_to_report.gif)\\\\n\\\\n## Data source\\\\n\\\\nDashboards rely on having **Reports** in the Project as a data source. \\\\n\\\\nWhen adding a Panel, you select a **Metric**, and Evidently pulls the corresponding value(s) from all Reports in the Project to plot them.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, if you log multiple Data Drift Reports (each includes the`DriftedColumnsCount` for the corresponding batch), you can plot how this Metric value changes over time.\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/dashboard/metric_panels.png)\\\\n\\\\nThe Panel time resolution depends on logged Report frequency. For instance, if you log Reports daily, you\\'ll see values at daily granularity.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use **Tags** to filter data from specific Reports. For example, you can plot the accuracy of Model A and Model B on separate Panels. To achieve this, you must first [add relevant Tags](/docs/library/tags_metadata) to the Report, and then filter by these Tags when creating a Panel.\\\\n\\\\n## What\\\\u2019s next?\\\\n\\\\n- See how to [customize dashboard via API](/docs/platform/dashboard_add_panels).\\\\n- See how to [customize dashboard via UI](/docs/platform/dashboard_add_panels_ui).\"'},\n",

If the metric isn\\'t present, the Panel will appear empty.\\\\n\\\\n**Dataset-level Metrics**: pass the Metric name directly to `PanelMetric`, e.g., `\\\\\"RowCount\\\\\"`.\\\\n\\\\nExample:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nproject.dashboard.add_panel(\\\\n             DashboardPanelPlot(\\\\n                title=\\\\\"Row count\\\\\",\\\\n                subtitle = \\\\\"Number of evaluations over time.\\\\\",\\\\n                size=\\\\\"half\\\\\",\\\\n                values=[\\\\n                    PanelMetric(\\\\n                        legend=\\\\\"Row count\\\\\",\\\\n                        metric=\\\\\"RowCount\\\\\", ## <- metric name\\\\n                    ),\\\\n                ],\\\\n                plot_params={\\\\\"plot_type\\\\\": \\\\\"line\\\\\"},\\\\n            ),\\\\n            tab=\\\\\"My tab\\\\\",\\\\n        )\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Presets** (like `TextEvals`, `ClassificationPreset`, `DataDriftPreset`) contain multiple sub-metrics. When logging Reports using a Preset, you must reference the specific **metric** inside it, such as `Accuracy`, `Recall`, etc.\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  **Need help finding metric names?** See the [All Metrics Reference Table](/metrics/all_metrics) for a full list of Metrics.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n### Metric labels\\\\n\\\\nSome Metrics require additional context. This applies when the metrics:\\\\n\\\\n- Operate at the column level\\\\n- Return multiple values (metric results)\\\\n- Have user-defined custom parameters\\\\n\\\\nIn these cases, use `metric_labels` to specify what exactly you want to plot.\\\\n\\\\n**Example**. To plot the share of categories inside \\\\\"Denials\\\\\" column:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nproject.dashboard.add_panel(\\\\n             DashboardPanelPlot(\\\\n                title=\\\\\"Denials\\\\\",\\\\n                subtitle = \\\\\"Number of denials.\\\\\",\\\\n                size=\\\\\"half\\\\\",\\\\n                values=[\\\\n                    PanelMetric(\\\\n                        legend=\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"{{label}}\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n                        metric=\\\\\"UniqueValueCount\\\\\", # <- metric from TextEvals Preset that computes distinct values\\\\n                        metric_labels={\\\\\"column\\\\\": \\\\\"denials\\\\\", #column name\\\\n                                       \\\\\"value_type\\\\\": \\\\\"share\\\\\" #metric result\\\\n                                       } \\\\n                    ),\\\\n                ],\\\\n                plot_params={\\\\\"plot_type\\\\\": \\\\\"bar\\\\\", \\\\\"is_stacked\\\\\": True},\\\\n            ),\\\\n            tab=\\\\\"My tab\\\\\",\\\\n        )\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Column / Descriptor**. When you compute a text descriptor or any metric that operates at the column level, use the `column` label to specify which column or descriptor it refers to.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, in a `TextEvals` Report, each text descriptor (e.g., text length, LLM judged \\\\\"denials\\\\\", etc.) is treated as a column. These descriptors are summarized with various statistics. To plot one of these values, you need to:\\\\n\\\\n- Choose a summary Metric like `UniqueValueCount`, `MissingValueCount`, `MaxValue`, etc.\\\\n- Use the `column` label to point the specific descriptor.\\\\n\\\\n**Example**. To plot the min value from the \\\\\"Text Length\\\\\" column:\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nvalues=[\\\\n    PanelMetric(\\\\n        legend=\\\\\"Min text length\\\\\",\\\\n        metric=\\\\\"MinValue\\\\\", # <- metric from TextEvals Preset that computes min value\\\\n        metric_labels={\\\\n            \\\\\"column\\\\\": \\\\\"TextLength\\\\\",  # <- target column name \\\\n        }\\\\n    )\\\\n]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Value type**. Most Evidently Metrics return a single `value`. For example, `Accuracy` returns the corresponding accuracy `value`. So listing just the `Metric` name is enough to specify what exactly you want to plot.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, some metrics produce more than one metric result, like:\\\\n\\\\n- `CategoryCount`: returns both `share` and `count`\\\\n- `MAE`: returns both `mean` and `std`\\\\n\\\\nIn this case, you must point to which value you want using the `value_type` key, e.g. `{\\\\\"value_type\\\\\": \\\\\"share\\\\\"}`\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nvalues = [\\\\n    PanelMetric(\\\\n        legend=\\\\\"Share\\\\\",\\\\n        metric=\\\\\"DriftedColumnsCount\\\\\",  # <- metric from Data Drift Preset that returns `count` or `share` of drifting columns\\\\n        metric_labels={\\\\\"value_type\\\\\": \\\\\"share\\\\\"}  # <- plot relative share\\\\n    ),\\\\n]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  **How to verify the metric result for a specific metric?**\\\\n\\\\n  - Look up the expected outputs in the [All Metrics Table](/metrics/all_metrics).\\\\n  - Or, generate a Report with the target `metric` and inspect its structure via`report.dict()` or `report.json()`.\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n**Metrics with extra parameters**. If a metric has configurable options (like drift method), you must also include those in `metric_labels`.\\\\n\\\\n### `PanelMetric` options\\\\n\\\\nA summary of all parameters:\\\\n\\\\n| Parameter       | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                      |\\\\n| --------------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\\\n| `legend`        | `str`  | \\\\u274c        | `None`  | Legend name in the panel.

Here’s a synthesis:\\n\\n1. **What is a Dashboard?**\\n   A dashboard serves as a visual interface to monitor AI application performance, allowing users to track evaluations across various experiments or live production quality over time.\\n\\n2. **Key Components:**\\n   - **Panels:** Each dashboard can include multiple panels, such as line plots, bar charts, or text-only displays, which show specific metrics. You can add panels either through the Python API or directly via the user interface in some environments.\\n   - **Tabs:** Multiple tabs can organize panels logically within a dashboard for ease of navigation.\\n\\n3. **Using the API:**\\n   The documentation details how to add or delete panels and tabs programmatically. Example code snippets are provided, showing how to customize panel types, sizes, and metrics displayed.\\n\\n4. **Metrics Source:**\\n   Dashboards pull data from reports generated within the project, which means having reports logged is essential for the dashboard to function effectively. Panels may display various metrics like totals or averages, based on the data available.\\n\\nIn summary, dashboards in this context are a powerful way to visualize and interact with performance data. You can add and arrange panels and tabs programmatically or through a graphical interface, which aids in monitoring metrics vital for evaluation and performance analysis.

To point to the Metric or Test to plot on a Panel, you use  `test_filters` or `metric_args `as shown above and pass `metric_id` or `metric_fingerprint` . They must include the name of the Metric that was logged to the Project. You must use the same Metic name (with any applicable parameters) that you used when creating the Report.\\\\n\\\\n<Note>\\\\n  **Working with Presets.** You must reference a named Evidently Metric even if you used a Preset. You can check the Metrics included in each Preset [here](/metrics/all_metrics).\\\\n</Note>\\\\n\\\\n**Field path**. For Metric Panels, you also specify the `field_path`. This helps point to a specific **result** inside the Metric. This can take the following values: `value` , `share`/`count` or `values` .\\\\n\\\\n| Field path         | Description                                          | Applicable Metrics                                                               | Applicable Panels |\\\\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\\\\n| `value`            | Points to a single result from the Metric.           | Most Metrics                                                                     | Counter, Plot     |\\\\n| `share` or `count` | Points to either absolute count or percentage value. | Metrics that return both absolute and percentage values like `MissingValueCount` | Counter, Plot     |\\\\n| `shares` or `counts`        | Points to a histogram visualization within a Metric. | Metrics with histogram visualizations,  like `UniqueValueCount`.                 | Distribution      |\\\\n\\\\nThere are a few exceptions where a Metric can return a different result or a dictionary.\\\\n\\\\n<Note>\\\\n  **How to verify the result of a specific Metric?** Check in the [All Metrics table](/metrics/all_metrics). You can also generate the Report with a given Metric, export the Report as JSON and check the value name it returns.\\\\n</Note>\\\\n\\\\nWhen working in the Evidently Cloud, you can see available fields in the drop-down menu as you add a new Panel.\"'},\n",

You can add multiple Tabs to organize them.\\\\n\\\\n**To add a Tab**:\\\\n\\\\n- Enter \\\\\"Edit\\\\\" mode on the Dashboard (top right corner).\\\\n- Click the plus sign with \\\\\"add Tab\\\\\" on the left.\\\\n- To create a custom Tab, select \\\\\"empty\\\\\" and enter a name.\\\\n\\\\nTo simplify setup, you can start with pre-built Tabs. These are dashboard templates with preset Panel combinations:\\\\n\\\\n![Add Dashboard Tab](/images/dashboard/add_dashboard_tab_v2.gif)\\\\n\\\\n**Pre-built Tabs** rely on having related Metrics (or Presets that include the specific Metrics) within the Project.

When you create a Panel, you pull the corresponding value from multiple Reports and show it over time or using the specified aggregation (sum, average, last).\\\\n\\\\n<Info>\\\\n  Check the preview and description of each Panel here: [How to add panels via Python API](dashboard_add_panels).\\\\n</Info>\\\\n\\\\n**How to add a Panel:**\\\\n\\\\n- Enter \\\\\"Edit\\\\\" mode on the Dashboard (top right corner).\\\\n- Click on the \\\\\"Add Panel\\\\\" button next to it.\\\\n- Follow the prompts to configure the panel.\\\\n- Use the preview to review your setup.\\\\n- Click \\\\\"Save\\\\\" and select the Tab where you want to add the Panel.\\\\n\\\\nHere is an example of the panel configuration view:\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/dashboard/add_panel_ui.png)\\\\n\\\\n- **Select Metrics**. To point to a specific Metric, you must choose the Metric name that matches the name of the Evidently Metric logged inside the Reports in the given Project.\\\\n- **Filter by Tag.** By default, the metrics will be parsed from all Reports in the Project. Use the \\\\\"From\\\\\" field to filter by Tags. (You must first attach these tags to the corresponding Reports).\\\\n- **Filter by Metric label.** If you have a single Metric of that type in the Project (like `RowCount`), it may be enough to just specify the metric name. However, if you have multiple instances of the same metric - as is often the case for column-level Metrics like `UniqueValueCount` - you need to specify additional parameters. Use the \\\\\"Where\\\\\" selector to specify further keys like:\\\\n  - **Column**: Use this to select the name of the column or descriptor.\\\\n  - **Value type**: Choose whether to plot value or count for metrics that return both.\\\\n\\\\n  You can see all keys available for a given Metric in the dropdown menu. You can add multiple keys, depending on the metric type, like metric-specific parameters.\\\\n- **Set Legend**. You can use the \\\\\"Label\\\\\" field to modify what appears on the legend.\\\\n- **Set Panel Type**. You can also specify the plot type and aggregation level.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, you can switch the view for the same metric as on the screenshot above to a pie chart and set the view to show only the last value instead of all values over time:\\\\n\\\\n![](/images/dashboard/add_panel_ui_pie.png)\\\\n\\\\n## **Deleting/Editing**\\\\n\\\\nTo delete or edit a Panel, enter Edit mode and hover over a specific Panel to choose an action.\"'},\n",
