      "   - You can create various types of panels (text, counters, pie charts, line plots, etc.) using either the user interface or Python API. Structuring panels allows for effective visualization of metrics and data evaluations over time. There are detailed instructions for adding, deleting, and managing tabs and panels, which help in organizing information efficiently.\n",

      "2. **Customization Options**:\n",
      "   - Panels can display diverse metrics and visual formats such as bar and line charts. Each panel includes parameters like title, size, and visual settings that can be tailored to suit the dashboard's overall appearance and functionality. For instance, metrics can be filtered or tagged for more contextual representation.\n",

      "   - **Edit Mode**: Begin by entering the “Edit” mode on the dashboard.\n",
      "   - **Adding Tabs**: You can add multiple tabs to organize your panels. This can be done by clicking the \"+ Add Tab\" button and selecting a name for the new tab.\n",
      "   - **Adding Panels**: Click on the \"Add Panel\" button and select the type of panel to create:\n",
      "     - **Types of Panels**: Options include text panels, counters, pie charts, line plots, and bar plots (grouped and stacked).\n",
      "     - **Configuration**: Each panel can be configured with a title, size, metrics (using `PanelMetric`), and visual settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Managing Panels**:\n",
      "   - You can delete or edit any panel or tab while in “Edit” mode. For instance, to delete a tab: `project.dashboard.delete_tab(\"Tab Name\")`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Saving and Organizing**:\n",
      "   - After configuring, always review the panels in the preview and ensure they are saved to the desired tab.\n",

      "    )\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Line Plot Example**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    project.dashboard.add_panel(\n",
      "        DashboardPanelPlot(\n",
      "            title=\"Evaluation Trends\",\n",
      "            subtitle=\"Trends over time.\",\n",

      "    )\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Dashboards allow for great flexibility in visualizing evaluation metrics. By leveraging the features to add tabs and panels, alongside customizing with various visual elements, users can create comprehensive views for tracking their AI applications' performance over time.\n",

      "   - Dashboards can have multiple tabs to organize panels effectively. Users can create custom tabs and select from pre-built templates.\n",
      "   - When adding panels, users specify metrics, panel types, titles, sizes, and plot parameters from a dropdown menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incorporating Metrics**:\n",
      "   - Metrics must be defined when configuring panels. This can include direct metrics like `RowCount`, or more complex metrics requiring specific labels for granularity (e.g., column-level statistics).\n",
