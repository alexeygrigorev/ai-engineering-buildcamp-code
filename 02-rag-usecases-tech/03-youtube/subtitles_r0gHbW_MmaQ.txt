00:00 Hi everyone, welcome to the second
00:02 iteration of AI engineering boot camp.
00:05 So I renamed the course recently. It
00:08 used to be called AI boot camp but there
00:10 are so many boot camps and AI boot camps
00:12 these days. So I was thinking if there's
00:15 a way to somehow be different from these
00:17 courses and uh maybe you know me by uh
00:21 from courses u from free courses from
00:24 data talks club which are called zoom
00:26 camps and u I thought okay like there we
00:30 have zoom camp how about I have some
00:32 other camp which is not a boot camp and
00:35 this idea of a built camp came uh came
00:38 up um I thought yeah I I really like uh
00:41 how it sounds cuz The focus in this
00:44 course is going to be on building. We
00:46 are going to do to program a lot to
00:49 build many things. So the focus is on
00:52 building and it's not just AI, it's AI
00:55 engineering. So we are going to build
00:57 systems around AI and we're going to
01:02 how do you call it? So we're going to
01:04 use this engineering mindset that
01:06 everything should be testable. We're
01:08 going to use built best.
01:10 We're going to use best practices for
01:13 everything. So, hence the name AI
01:15 engineering build up. So, um the plan
01:19 for today is um I'm going to share my
01:22 screen
01:24 and the plan for today uh is I want to
01:27 show you around this platform
01:30 um and uh together with you I want to go
01:33 over this uh first section of week
01:36 number one which is course overview and
01:38 preparation. So we'll go over it and
01:41 then at the end I'll be happy to answer
01:43 any questions you want. Um so yeah
01:46 that's the plan for today. Uh and
01:50 I guess uh we will just start with it.
01:54 So this is the
01:56 student portal. I think this is how it's
01:58 called and this is the URL. So it's /2
02:01 the second cohort and when you join you
02:04 should see some you should see something
02:06 like this. So our class is here. This
02:09 our first first session and then this is
02:12 the content. Um I can I think yeah you
02:16 need to click home. So there is also sub
02:19 channels. Most of the interaction like
02:22 the interactions will not really happen
02:24 here. Uh it will happen in Slack. I'll
02:26 talk more about this. But here of course
02:29 you can write me and I will see your
02:30 message if you write me. Um but it's
02:33 better to hang out in Slack where uh
02:36 people from the previous cohort are also
02:38 there so they can um perhaps um share
02:42 some of their
02:44 some of the things. Anyways, so this is
02:47 the home window and here we see things
02:51 um like split by week, week one, week
02:53 two and so on. And since I re-recorded
02:58 um compared to cohort number one, I
03:01 rearranged the the curriculum curriculum
03:04 of the course. And you can see that some
03:07 of the things, some of the sections are
03:09 marked as old. So all the old content is
03:12 kept for now. So if you're interested,
03:15 you can go through this too. Um but
03:17 yeah, it's clearly indicated as old and
03:20 the new content doesn't have this. But
03:23 this is how you navigate. So you just
03:25 okay we're interested in course overview
03:26 and preparation. You click on this and
03:29 then you go through the content.
03:32 Another important thing is I want to
03:34 make this course more focused and I want
03:37 it to clearly split into what is
03:40 optional, what is the core or sorry what
03:42 is optional, what is not optional. So
03:44 what is the core part and what are the
03:46 nice to have parts. So all the optional
03:49 things are marked with a star here. So
03:52 you see like search bonus materials
03:53 alternatives to open AAI these are the
03:56 optional sections of week number one but
03:59 course overview and preparation uh
04:01 foundation and structured output they
04:03 are not optional they are core content.
04:06 So um you should go through this core
04:09 content but optional is if you have time
04:12 then you go through this
04:14 and uh what we will also do during
04:16 office hours is um you can tell me okay
04:19 I'm working on this project and I can
04:21 tell you then you should check this
04:23 optional material but for now so this is
04:26 how it looks like in the maven platform
04:29 what I want to do is I want to go
04:31 through uh these things here so I think
04:34 I did a short course overview. No, I
04:37 showed only the platform, but probably
04:40 you saw this page, right? So, this page
04:42 tells you the overview of the things
04:44 we're going to cover. Um, I'll probably
04:48 give you a a little bit more detailed
04:50 overview. So, here this is the updated
04:53 curriculum. This is not something you
04:55 see, but I just want to use this as a
05:00 for me as a guideline to explain what we
05:02 are going to cover. What? So this is
05:04 currently the state the most upto-date
05:08 state of the curriculum of our syllabus
05:10 right now on the platform. If we go here
05:16 um yeah I still need to update it. Um
05:19 it's only one week update is updated
05:21 anyways. So we I already told you about
05:24 the week number one but in the second
05:26 week. So the second week in the first
05:28 week we are going to actually only told
05:31 you what is um core part and what is not
05:35 core part. Maybe now I actually tell you
05:37 what is what we are going to cover in
05:39 each of the parts.
05:41 So course overview is what we are doing
05:43 right now and after that uh we will
05:47 learn about the foundation for the
05:50 entire course. So we will learn what
05:52 LLMs are, how to interact with them. So
05:54 we will use OpenAI but OpenAI is while I
05:58 use it for most of the videos, you can
06:01 easily switch it with some other LLM
06:04 provider. I will also show you how to do
06:06 this. And here we will see how to use
06:08 OpenAI and how to build our rack
06:12 application. rack is the
06:15 uh most used application of AI and this
06:19 is a way of adding some uh information
06:22 to LLM that it doesn't know adding some
06:24 context. So we are going to do this in
06:28 the first week um this week and yeah the
06:32 focus will be on rack and on preparing
06:34 data to be used in rack
06:39 right so here we will talk about things
06:42 like search and we will talk about
06:44 things like communicating with uh an LLM
06:46 and another core part of this is
06:48 structured output so this is when you
06:50 force an LM to produce output that uh
06:54 that follows certain and structure
06:56 certain format which is pretty important
06:58 in many applications of AI that's why
07:01 we're going to cover it today too and
07:03 then uh the next week is going to be a
07:06 buffer buffer week uh what I mean by
07:08 buffer is right now you are preparing
07:11 the environment you are trying to get
07:13 familiar with the course some of you
07:15 might be might be um might be joining a
07:18 bit late a few days late like I don't
07:20 know Wednesday and Thursday who knows so
07:23 then uh the purpose of Second week is to
07:25 give you enough time to make sure that
07:28 you not only you set up the environment
07:30 but you also manage to go through the
07:32 core content of
07:34 uh week number one. So week number two
07:37 has only optional materials and what we
07:40 are going to do in week number two is
07:42 for those who have more time who didn't
07:44 have any problems with setting up the
07:46 environment is we're going to cover
07:49 extra use cases. So in week number one
07:51 we will introduce the running example.
07:54 The running example will be using
07:59 the documentation from this evidently.
08:03 So this is the library we're going to um
08:06 this is the data set we're going to use.
08:08 So this is um this is documentation from
08:11 an open source library that is used for
08:14 evaluating LLM applications evaluating
08:16 agents and we are going to build rack
08:19 for this content right and this is going
08:23 to be our running example the example we
08:25 are going to use throughout the course
08:26 but in week number two I will introduce
08:28 other examples so if you're interested
08:30 in learning more about rack so then you
08:33 will do this in uh week number two so
08:36 we'll talk about FAQ assistant
08:38 We'll talk about uh a a system that is
08:42 answering questions about YouTube videos
08:45 and we will also talk about search with
08:47 elastic search and search with quadrant.
08:49 So this is something we're going to
08:51 cover on week number two. I don't as I
08:53 said all this material is not core
08:55 material. If you don't do any of these
08:58 videos uh you will still learn quite a
09:00 lot but if you have extra time um you
09:04 should check these videos too. So this
09:06 is what will happen uh during second
09:08 week. Um every week week we'll have
09:12 homework. So week number one we'll have
09:14 I still need to publish it. Um but
09:17 starting from week number one starting
09:19 from today we will already start
09:22 thinking about projects. So and the goal
09:26 of the homework is not only solidify
09:28 what you learned and try to to redo some
09:30 of the things. So you will do some mini
09:32 projects but also you will need to start
09:34 thinking about your capstone project. So
09:37 first you'll just think about the idea
09:39 what exactly I want to have at hand.
09:41 It's fine if you don't know yet now
09:43 because you're here to learn, right? But
09:46 some of you came here with a clear idea
09:48 what you want to implement or maybe not
09:50 clear idea but way idea some ideas of
09:53 what you possibly can do at the end of
09:54 the course by the end of the course.
09:56 Right? So now we will also start
09:58 thinking about this and we continue
10:00 thinking about this on week number two.
10:02 Right? And again it's okay if you don't
10:05 have
10:07 any idea of what you want to implement
10:08 at the end. Um but in this case you
10:13 should tell uh us about that in Slack
10:17 and u we can come up with some idea that
10:20 might be interesting for you right and
10:23 then once we are done with the
10:25 foundation once we learn how to
10:26 communicate with uh an LLM provider once
10:30 we know what track is and how to
10:32 implement it we will start talking about
10:34 agents so week number three is devoted
10:37 to agents so we will what is the
10:40 difference between uh traditional rack
10:42 and agentic rock and what agents uh what
10:46 is an agent. So we are going to cover it
10:49 here. Um we're I'm also going to
10:52 introduce one main framework that we are
10:54 going to use as uh throughout the
10:57 course. The framework is called pentki.
11:01 Um but in addition to that as bonus
11:04 materials as optional materials I will
11:06 show you other frameworks. So last
11:09 cohort we had two frameworks as like
11:12 main frameworks open AAI agents SDK and
11:15 Pentic AI and um I found it confusing at
11:19 the end. So one of them became optional
11:21 but also in addition to open agent SDK
11:24 I'm going to cover other frameworks like
11:26 lchain crew AI and Google ADK right so
11:30 then uh for you you can choose whatever
11:32 you want so the majority of the examples
11:36 um most of the examples in this course
11:39 are going to be in pidenti but since we
11:42 are going to start with implementing
11:44 things ourselves and then switch to the
11:46 framework you will understand what the
11:48 framework is actually doing under the
11:50 hood. So then it doesn't really matter
11:52 at the end which framework you use
11:54 because at the end inside they implement
11:58 very similar things.
12:00 And then we also in week three we'll
12:02 talk about um MCP
12:06 and we'll build a small agent. This is
12:09 optional material. Uh MCP is optional
12:11 material and this is also optional
12:13 material. We're going to build a small
12:15 agent that can use uh a search engine, a
12:18 real search engine from the web and
12:20 fetch data from YouTube and then answer
12:22 questions uh answer your questions based
12:25 on that. And then we also as a part of
12:27 homework we build a mini project and
12:30 then we uh continue thinking about our
12:33 project our capstone project.
12:37 Uh in week four we do a very important
12:40 thing. So now in week three we learn how
12:43 to implement agents but then um we don't
12:47 know if our agents are reliable. So in
12:50 week number four the focus is on testing
12:52 these agents and making sure these
12:54 agents actually do what we want them to
12:56 do. So we're going to cover them with
12:58 tests. um different type of test unit
13:01 test, judge test, judge
13:04 judge test are when we use an LLM to
13:06 evaluate to test another LLM, right? To
13:09 test our agent and then as a bonus um we
13:13 will also talk about multi- aent
13:14 systems. I made it as a bonus section
13:17 because I think in many cases you don't
13:19 actually need a multi- aent uh system.
13:22 It just complicates things. But it's
13:24 still nice to know that these things
13:26 exist and when it time comes and when
13:30 your agent one agent does not can no
13:33 longer handle many tasks that you wanted
13:35 to handle then you will need to split
13:38 your agent into multiple. So whether
13:41 during the course or maybe after the
13:43 course when you realize that you need to
13:46 know how to do this you can come back to
13:48 these materials and learn how to
13:50 implement multi- aent systems right and
13:53 homework again small mini project based
13:55 on the week's material and then continue
13:58 thinking and doing some little things
14:01 for your capstone. Then um in week
14:04 number four the focus is on testing and
14:08 week number five is about monitoring. So
14:11 we implemented the agent, we tested the
14:13 agent, we deployed the agent and now we
14:16 start collecting the logs. Now we start
14:18 collecting real interactions, real user
14:20 interactions. So in this week we will
14:23 talk about setting this up making it
14:26 possible to collect all these logs to
14:27 collect all these interactions of the
14:29 user with the our system
14:32 and uh yeah we'll talk about systems
14:34 like uh we'll talk about protocols like
14:37 open telemetry and systems like pentic
14:39 clock fire for doing this right and in
14:42 addition to that um as optional material
14:44 but I highly highly encourage you if you
14:47 have time to take uh this section two
14:51 which is do it yourself login and
14:52 monitoring where we will see where I
14:56 will show you how to implement a login
14:58 system from scratch and collect logs um
15:02 in some sort of block collecting system
15:04 and then put them into posgress
15:09 and build the graphana dashboard right
15:12 so here the setup is pretty simple so
15:14 this one is more advanced so if you have
15:16 time uh check this out and then we will
15:19 check other observability platform forms
15:20 like evidently and language both of them
15:22 are open source there are also some
15:25 closed source libraries um there are
15:28 many of them um yeah and at the end they
15:31 are quite similar so I think if I cover
15:33 just these two should be enough for you
15:35 to figure out how any other system works
15:38 homework again little project to
15:41 understand what the week was about and
15:43 then continue working on your capstone
15:47 and then week number six is uh I think
15:50 it's going to be our final week where we
15:55 learn some things and it's going to be
15:57 about evaluation. So we um implemented
16:02 our agent, we tested our agent um but we
16:05 want to understand how our agent
16:07 performs in general, right? Let's say
16:12 we
16:14 interact with the system 1,00 times and
16:16 we want to make sure that all these
16:18 10,000 times uh the interaction is what
16:21 we expect. Right? So we talk about
16:25 creating the gold standard data set with
16:27 our evalation data evaluating this agent
16:29 and building this data set the gold
16:31 standard data set from the interaction
16:33 with the interactions with the user that
16:35 we set up in the previous week. So we're
16:37 going to talk about this. We're also
16:39 going to talk about imple evaluating not
16:42 only evaluating agents but also
16:43 evaluating our search uh as a part of um
16:47 our rack
16:50 and that's the core material. So this is
16:52 what we are going to focus on uh during
16:56 these six weeks or I'd say five weeks
16:59 because second week is also kind of
17:00 bonus. So this is the core uh theory and
17:04 practical part right and starting from
17:07 week seven we are going to focus on
17:10 projects right so if before we were just
17:13 thinking about project getting some
17:15 ideas making little steps here the goal
17:18 is to focus completely on the project
17:20 right and um
17:24 here uh I will also give a complete
17:27 project example you will not actually
17:29 need to reproduce it if you want you
17:31 But here the idea is to give you an
17:34 example of an end toend project capstone
17:37 project that you can implement too.
17:38 Right? So here the example is I have a
17:41 system with to-do list and uh I want to
17:45 interact with this to-do list through an
17:47 agent. Right? So this is could be
17:49 similar to what you want to build as a
17:51 part of your capstone project. Right? So
17:53 the goal here is to show that an end to-
17:56 end process from uh setting everything
17:59 up, creating tools, configuring agent to
18:03 actually uh deploying, evaluating and
18:05 monitoring it. Right? So this would be
18:08 an example uh for your capstone project
18:11 that you can reproduce to. And then I
18:14 added a few uh sections, extra sections
18:17 here about guardrails. Um, guard rails
18:21 are things that check input and output
18:22 of your systems. So, if this is
18:25 something important for you, you can
18:26 check it. Otherwise, it's not the core
18:28 content. It's not um a must have for uh
18:32 completing your capstone and starting uh
18:35 working with agents. But this is an
18:37 important thing. Um so, if you have time
18:40 and if you need this, then you check it
18:43 during the week number seven earlier or
18:46 later, right? So later a few months
18:48 after you finish the course you realize
18:50 that this is what you need. You just
18:52 come back and check the videos uh from
18:55 what I understood all the materials from
18:57 the this cohort will be available for
18:59 you forever. So at any point of time you
19:01 can come back and check these materials
19:04 and then I also want to cover
19:06 deployment. So this is not something we
19:08 had in the previous module but in the
19:11 previous edition of the course but
19:13 course participants students were asking
19:15 uh for this. So I also want to include a
19:18 module about deployment which could be
19:20 like very simple like just deploying
19:22 your streaml application. Um most
19:26 students figure this out u themselves
19:28 cuz it's pretty simple. I still want to
19:30 record a video showing you how to do
19:32 this, but then we'll take a look at more
19:35 at other platforms for doing this.
19:37 Right? Then uh so you start working on
19:40 your project on week number seven, you
19:41 continue working on week number eight
19:44 and in week number eight u again the
19:47 focus is on the project but also there
19:50 are some uh use cases that I want to
19:53 cover. Again up to you if you want to
19:54 implement them or not. Maybe you just
19:56 want to watch, maybe you just want to
19:58 read uh to go through um the written
20:01 part. Up to you. Or like if you don't
20:03 have a time at all, just focus on the
20:04 project and come back to these materials
20:06 later after the course. And these use
20:08 cases that I want to cover are building
20:11 a coding agent. So something like uh
20:14 clot code or lovable or github copilot,
20:18 an agent that can analyze your code. So
20:21 you give it a source code um some
20:24 archive with source code and you ask a
20:27 question about this and it can answer
20:29 questions about that and deep research
20:32 agent an agent that can do some research
20:36 in our case uh I'm going to use uh the
20:40 all the transcripts from the data talks
20:42 club podcast and based on uh this data
20:45 set we can ask things about career
20:48 development learning something and
20:51 things like that. Right? So this is
20:53 going to be one use case and then I'm
20:55 going to have a use cases library which
20:59 are short videos about uh some things uh
21:02 that I have uh um implemented or came
21:07 across
21:09 or somehow contributed to that uh could
21:12 be interesting for you and inspiring not
21:14 just for your capstone projects but in
21:16 general if you want to implement some
21:18 authentic stuff. Um and then last
21:21 section
21:23 is examples of other um from other
21:27 students either from the first cohort or
21:29 from some other open courses that uh
21:31 data do club has right and then week
21:34 number nine is demo where you're
21:37 presenting everything you built. So this
21:40 is going to be an open presentation.
21:43 Um so you get uh a chance to uh show
21:47 what you built, what you learned to
21:49 everyone who wants to join. So I will uh
21:53 promote it across like on my social
21:55 media uh on Maven. So everyone who is
21:58 not necessarily part of this cohort can
22:00 join this demo. Right? And then um at
22:04 this point of time you have a project,
22:06 right? So you present it and then it's
22:08 just final week where we are going to do
22:10 peer review. So peer review is uh the
22:12 process where um last two weeks before
22:17 this you worked on your projects and
22:19 actually like starting from today you
22:21 need to start thinking about your
22:22 project right but last week after you
22:24 demo you still have a bit of time. Uh
22:27 this time you'll take to learn from your
22:29 peers. So every one of you will be
22:32 assigned to uh two three uh peer reviews
22:37 to evaluate three projects from other uh
22:39 from other course participants. The goal
22:42 here not only to evaluate and to see how
22:46 good they project is but the main focus
22:48 here is to learn from your peers to
22:50 understand what they built, what the
22:52 problem they were solving, what kind of
22:54 tools they use for that. uh when it
22:57 comes to agents, what kind of uh tools
22:59 this agent has, what kind of frameworks
23:01 they use, how did they evaluate, how did
23:03 they go about testing. So here the goal
23:06 is to learn as much as possible from uh
23:08 other course participants, but also you
23:11 want to uh evaluate to see how well they
23:15 did the project. And then if you do
23:18 this, if you build your project and if
23:20 you do peer review, then you get a
23:23 certificate at the end.
23:25 And then um the official part of the
23:27 course is over after week nine after we
23:29 do the demo after we do peer review
23:31 after you get the certificates it's
23:33 over. But if you want to stick around a
23:35 bit longer there is a chance to uh build
23:38 something uh not necessarily with what
23:40 you learn in the course could be any AI
23:43 application could be another portfolio
23:46 project. So we are going to have a two
23:49 weeks two week long hackathon where you
23:52 can work on anything you want. Uh we
23:54 have some ideas. Uh these ideas are
23:56 coming from data talks club mostly what
23:59 you can do but you uh should feel free
24:02 to if you want to take part you should
24:04 feel free to bring your ideas find team
24:07 members you can work solo you can work
24:09 with others doesn't really matter. So
24:12 the goal here is if you want to build if
24:14 you want to continue building something
24:16 then there are two weeks more
24:19 um even though they are not really
24:21 official. So on Maven uh it will be
24:24 marked as complete after week nine but
24:27 you can stick around and build some cool
24:29 stuff with um your pierce. Right. So
24:32 that's the overview of the course. So
24:35 this is what we are going to do. So it's
24:37 going to be um a lot of fun and I think
24:40 I should not have stopped sharing my
24:43 screen cuz I want to do to show you some
24:46 other things. Right. So basically what I
24:49 did right now is I covered this course
24:51 overview right so all the things we're
24:54 going to cover uh in any uh in all the
24:58 weeks all the technologies we used and
25:00 so on right
25:02 then all the interactions uh so that's
25:04 another thing I want to talk about
25:06 communication um and our slack community
25:11 um so communication about the course so
25:14 yes there is this uh platform the
25:16 student portal that we have in Maven. Uh
25:20 but we should use u datadox club lab for
25:24 uh communicating. So in order to sign up
25:27 if you don't have an account yet so you
25:29 go to this link put your email here
25:32 click join and you should receive an
25:34 email with a link. If you don't for some
25:36 reasons, just send me a message and I
25:40 will add you to this platform uh to this
25:42 slack and then I will stop sharing for a
25:46 second cuz I want to make sure that my
25:48 slack um so cuz I want to show you my
25:51 slack. I don't want to accidentally show
25:54 any anything sensitive. Okay, I think it
25:57 should be fine.
25:59 So this is how our slack looks like,
26:02 right? And then this is our course
26:03 course AI build camp. You might not have
26:06 it at the beginning when you join. Uh
26:09 and you certainly will have a lot less
26:12 channels. Um where is it? There should
26:16 be the button
26:18 here. Channels. You see this uh
26:25 trying to find
26:28 a join channel. Did they move it?
26:33 Okay. Anyways, um join Slack channel.
26:40 So, here we have the instructions how to
26:42 join a channel. Um yeah, if you have
26:46 problems finding the channel, but
26:48 actually uh I don't know why this click
26:51 this link is not clickable. This should
26:54 be clickable. So, I'll fix it. So what
26:56 you can do once you're in Slack you just
26:57 click on this link and you'll uh see the
27:00 channel right and what we do in this
27:03 channel you can ask any question you
27:04 want um um like if you get stuck if you
27:08 have any generic question um so yeah use
27:13 this for asking for help a few rules um
27:18 so most of these rules you can find here
27:21 if you go uh here our community
27:23 guidelines but uh Please use threads.
27:26 Threads help to make the interaction in
27:30 Slack more organized.
27:32 And uh yeah, there is some code of
27:34 conduct. You can read through this if
27:37 you're interested. And uh this Slack is
27:40 not just for this course. There are many
27:42 many things happen. So don't post things
27:45 related to the course in general. Please
27:47 find the this channel first, the course
27:49 channel and then ask um ask your
27:53 question there. So this link is going to
27:54 be quite useful. So this is
27:56 documentation of which channels are
27:59 there.
28:01 Okay. So that's uh slack.
28:05 Um
28:07 then as we go through the course
28:10 and you saw when I was talking about uh
28:13 course overview week by week uh things
28:16 we were I mentioned homework right all
28:19 this homework uh when you work on the
28:22 homework uh so first of all you commit
28:24 your code to your GitHub repo but then
28:28 you will need to also submit this
28:30 homework and in order to submit we will
28:33 use this um course management platform,
28:37 right? So this is how it looked like
28:39 last year.
28:41 Um yeah, we cannot see it here but
28:44 basically for each homework there was
28:46 this um homework form, right? You would
28:50 go there and you would provide your
28:52 answer to this homework form and then
28:56 you submit, right? So this is how you do
28:58 this. Um there is also a leaderboard.
29:01 You can see how everyone is cuz everyone
29:04 is um like some people ask answer
29:08 questions correctly, some people are
29:09 answer question incorrectly. Um then
29:12 also I want to learn uh to I want to
29:14 talk about learning in public what it is
29:16 but also you get some extra points for
29:18 that. So I don't need to talk a lot
29:21 about this. So there is this PL course
29:24 management platform guide that you can
29:28 use to go through and understand like
29:30 what kind of things are there. We're
29:32 going to use it for uh project
29:34 submission for peer uh review and things
29:37 like that. So this is the platform I
29:40 developed for our open courses for Zoom
29:43 camps and I'm just reusing it for uh our
29:46 courses here and our course is actually
29:50 hidden from here. You can only access it
29:53 using the direct link and direct link
29:56 for you cohort number two is this one.
29:59 So right now there's nothing uh once uh
30:03 there will be homework I will make an
30:05 announcement and you can submit it right
30:10 okay learning in public I mentioned um
30:12 that you're getting some points for
30:14 learning in public so what is learning
30:15 in public so learning in public is a
30:18 concept where you don't learn in private
30:22 so learning in private is okay I learn
30:24 something and I keep it to myself I
30:26 don't tell anyone about that learning in
30:29 public is the opposite of that. So you
30:30 learn something and then you share with
30:33 others what you learn. Typically it is
30:36 just making a post on social media that
30:38 today I learned this right could be also
30:41 writing a blog post about what you
30:42 learned and again sharing it on social
30:44 media. Um the main advantage of that is
30:49 um
30:51 you kind of try to teach others right.
30:53 So when you take these notes you show
30:55 the okay I learned this and this is how
30:57 you can or you explain these things and
31:00 when you explain these things that you
31:02 learned uh or you summarize the things
31:04 you learned uh it forces you to um
31:09 understand to focus on understanding the
31:11 material better right you don't want to
31:12 post something that is not correct so
31:15 you double check yourself you um
31:20 invest more time into learning this
31:22 thing that's one benefit of is and
31:24 another benefit is you get noticed,
31:26 right? I don't know why you're taking
31:28 this course. Maybe it's for upskilling
31:30 and doing a project at work, but maybe
31:32 you're looking for a new job. I don't
31:34 know. But if you're looking for a new
31:36 job, then it's especially important for
31:38 you to learn in public, right? To share
31:40 what you do cuz you get visibility.
31:44 So people will see that you share this
31:46 thing and they will know that you know
31:50 this thing, right? Even though yes you
31:52 are sharing it from the kind of learner
31:55 learner perspective still people notice
31:58 um and then it may lead to many good
32:01 opportunities so if you don't believe me
32:03 there is an article that I wrote on my
32:06 substack the benefits of learning in
32:08 public I'm not going to go through the
32:10 entire uh article here it's for you to
32:13 learn but in data docs club uh I host
32:17 podcasts regularly and many people uh in
32:21 this podcast the guests they shared how
32:24 learning in public was beneficial for
32:26 their career and here is just a summary
32:29 of a few talks of that right so you can
32:32 go through this and if you don't believe
32:35 me maybe you will believe um this but I
32:38 strongly encourage you not just for this
32:41 course but in general to learn what you
32:44 uh to share what you learn because of
32:46 all the benefits I just described and
32:48 plus there are more things. So, please
32:51 check it out. I know it could be
32:53 difficult to start at first, but then uh
32:57 you will definitely not regret it.
33:00 Okay. So, here's some materials about
33:02 that office hours. So, what we have
33:05 right now I call office hours. So, these
33:07 are live sessions that we have where we
33:10 get together um and typically I answer
33:14 your questions. So the first office hour
33:16 session is uh different because I give
33:19 you an overview of the course but in
33:21 general the you watch the videos you do
33:24 some things and then you have questions
33:26 and this is the time when we have some
33:28 sort of reverse classroom I think this
33:30 is how it's called where you come to me
33:34 with questions and I answer these
33:35 questions. So this is the time for you
33:37 to uh clarify some things about the
33:40 content of the course. Of course, you
33:41 can use the Slack for that, but for some
33:43 discussions, um, real time interaction
33:46 is better than just asking fix and
33:48 slack, right? Um, plus some important
33:51 things. Plus, we're going to talk about
33:53 your projects, we're going to talk about
33:55 your homeworks.
33:57 And typically, when you have some ideas
33:59 and you're not sure how to approach
34:02 these ideas, ideas for your capstone
34:03 project, approach, ideas for your mini
34:05 projects, I don't know, for boot for um,
34:09 hackathon at the end. So here we can do
34:12 some sort of brainstorming like you have
34:14 this idea how exactly you should go
34:16 about implementing this idea. So this is
34:18 the time when we talk about these
34:20 things. So it starts at 5:00 p.m. Berlin
34:23 time. So the time it started today. Um
34:26 here you have some I converted it to
34:30 different time zones. The important
34:33 thing though is to keep in mind that we
34:35 have this daylight saving adjustments.
34:37 very annoying thing you ask if you ask
34:39 me and what is all even more annoying
34:43 about it is that in Europe and in the
34:47 states it happens at different times. So
34:49 what can happen that states uh go the
34:54 United States of America
34:56 adjust they do this daylight saving
34:59 switch in March 8 and we in Europe only
35:03 do this uh two three three weeks later
35:06 right which means that uh during this
35:09 time when uh the US is already in the
35:12 new time zone and we're still in the old
35:14 time zone the time will be different
35:16 right so this is something you need to
35:17 keep in mind that If at some point the
35:22 Zoom meeting doesn't start when it was
35:24 supposed to start and it's March, then
35:26 probably it's because of that, right? So
35:28 this is something to keep in mind.
35:31 And um so this is this happens live but
35:35 you can ask your questions offline. So
35:39 uh there is a slider link which yeah
35:41 here submit questions for slido. So you
35:43 can lo use this link to submit your
35:45 questions here and uh you can submit you
35:49 can use this link to submit your
35:50 question anytime you want and then every
35:53 time we start the office hours I will
35:56 first open this and see if there are
35:58 questions there right also some
36:00 questions slack if they require longer
36:02 time to answer I will um
36:06 yeah I will also take my time uh and
36:09 answer uh this in um in office hours,
36:13 right? And then um everything that we
36:16 say is like everything that we discuss
36:18 in this office hours is recorded
36:21 and then I share a written summary.
36:24 Right? So first of all there is a video.
36:27 Right? So u this is a video that you can
36:30 go through and check
36:32 um right so this is from the previous
36:35 cohort.
36:36 Um first of all there is a video but if
36:39 you don't feel like watching video and
36:41 you'd rather have um just a recap a text
36:43 recap we also
36:46 uh prepare a summary right so here is
36:48 summary uh the way this summary is
36:50 generated I don't think it will be a
36:52 surprise to you it's just we dump the
36:54 transcript to judge and say ask it to
36:56 structure it and then this is the result
36:58 but you can go through this there are
37:00 time stamps time codes and then you can
37:02 think okay like actually I want to check
37:04 what they we're talking about here on
37:06 this time stamp. So you go to the video
37:08 and check. So you will have a summary
37:10 like that for every
37:13 uh every office like every live session,
37:17 right? And um so this is what I showed
37:19 you was cohort number one, previous
37:22 cohort. This one is cohort number two.
37:24 Right now it's empty because we did not
37:27 have any uh office hours so far, any
37:30 sessions, but this is where they are
37:32 going to be, right?
37:36 I see that there are some questions. Let
37:37 me quickly check.
37:40 Uh
37:43 building in public in our cases can help
37:45 can help get HR attention. By HR you
37:48 probably mean recruiters, right? That's
37:50 correct. Paulo,
37:52 uh can can we for example pin Google
37:55 calendar, event, Zoom, uh etc. and let
37:58 them handle time zones?
38:00 Yes, I think this is what um happens. So
38:05 Maven creates calendar and sends to
38:07 everyone.
38:09 Um and technically they should handle
38:13 this but in what happened in practice
38:15 what happened last year is I got
38:17 messages hey like why didn't we start
38:19 the course at their usual time. Yeah. So
38:23 there's um
38:26 yeah so it's not ideal. You may forget
38:29 about things. In my case, for some
38:31 reasons, Maven uh these Maven meetings
38:35 did not end up in my calendar. So, I
38:37 have to have a reminder that I said I'm
38:39 in my personal calendar that this
38:41 meeting start, right? So, perhaps um
38:45 yeah, if you just go here, home,
38:48 and I think you just click here, join,
38:50 then it should be fine, right? And as
38:52 far as I can see, this already shows it
38:55 in the in your time zone. Well, at least
38:58 for me it shows mine. Um, I hope for you
39:01 it also shows uh it in your demog.
39:06 Okay, that was office hours.
39:09 So the next two videos is about
39:11 preparing the environment. So these
39:14 videos are already recorded. You can
39:15 just go through this. There are two
39:17 videos. The first one is uh GitHub code
39:21 spaces which is remote environment for
39:23 course and the second one is local
39:25 environment preparation which is in my
39:27 case is Windows but it should work for
39:29 Mac OS and Linux too. So the core
39:32 difference between these two is uh
39:34 GitHub code spaces is a remote
39:36 environment and it already has docker it
39:38 already has Python. You don't need to
39:40 install anything except uh well you you
39:43 need to have a GitHub account and you
39:45 need to have um Visual Studio Code
39:47 Desktop. That's it. Uh even the set
39:50 second one the Visual Studio Code
39:52 Desktop is kind of optional cuz you do
39:56 you can do the everything from the
39:57 browser which I don't really like. I
40:00 prefer to have um Visual Studio Code
40:02 Desktop.
40:04 So the advantages of that is um no
40:07 matter which computer you use, you
40:09 always have access to your files, right?
40:11 The disadvantage of that is
40:14 while they have a very generous uh free
40:16 tier, at some point you may accidentally
40:18 hit the free quarter limit and either
40:21 you have to pay or you cannot use it.
40:24 Right? That's why I suggest that you
40:26 always have even if you use code spaces
40:29 as your main environment always have
40:32 have local environment prepared because
40:35 this is what happened to me last month.
40:37 I run out of quarter. So I had to
40:39 reconfigure everything to run locally,
40:42 right? So this is not always ideal. Um
40:44 so please have two environments and then
40:47 it's up to you which one to choose or
40:50 actually you don't have to have two,
40:52 right? So you can only have local. It's
40:54 alo totally fine. So here I showed how
40:56 to do this on Windows. Uh on Windows I
40:59 just needed to do one extra step which
41:01 is installing git bash for Windows which
41:03 has bash. But if you're on Linux or Mac
41:06 OS, you don't need to do this. You
41:07 already have Bash.
41:11 Okay. A few things before we finish the
41:14 with the overview
41:16 is AI system development.
41:18 So AI assisted development is all these
41:21 tools like we have here examples right
41:25 CH GPT, GitHub copilot, cursor, cloud
41:28 code and so on.
41:30 it's completely okay and I encourage you
41:33 to use these tools. Right? So to me I
41:35 don't see any problem in uh using these
41:39 tools if they really help you learn if
41:41 they help you be more productive if you
41:44 can achieve more using these tools with
41:47 these tools than without these tools. I
41:48 personally I am a big fan of these
41:51 tools. I've been using AI for code for
41:55 assisting me with code for more than two
41:57 years. Ever since um GPT4 was released.
42:01 I was trying to use it when GPT3.5 was
42:04 there. It wasn't ideal. But uh like even
42:08 then it was producing some code but like
42:10 I've been using it for quite some time
42:12 and my productivity has increased. I can
42:15 do more with less time. So I strongly
42:18 recommend if you don't use this yet I
42:22 recommend using it. That said um don't
42:25 just copy paste the homework blindly
42:29 like and say hey solve me this homework
42:32 cuz this way you will not learn much. So
42:34 I would encourage you to even if you do
42:36 this if you just say hey solve this
42:38 homework
42:39 which is fine by me right? So at the end
42:41 it's um you who who is learning not me
42:44 right? try to make sure that you
42:47 understand everything that this this
42:49 code uh assistants produce right in some
42:52 cases it doesn't really matter as long
42:54 as it's working right but in some cases
42:56 you really want to understand what is
42:57 happening inside and for this course um
43:01 there are cases like that right so when
43:03 you implement something especially when
43:05 it comes to AI things you want to
43:07 understand what is happening under the
43:08 hood right so in some cases when we
43:11 implement UI in streaml maybe it's less
43:14 important it works works then it's fine
43:16 don't touch it right uh but in some
43:18 cases when we implement a system for
43:20 storing logs from our agent then maybe
43:24 you want to understand how it works
43:25 right so
43:27 uh I so what I want to say is I
43:30 encourage you to use these tools but um
43:33 handle them with care don't just blindly
43:36 use them as code generators
43:38 use them as learning tools as uh your
43:42 performance uh how to say improver
43:45 enhancer right
43:48 um yeah so also we are going to use in
43:52 some of the lessons I'm going to
43:54 generate some code right so while I have
43:58 all of well I cancelled my cursor
44:00 subscription but I can pretty much use
44:03 so my favorite one is GitHub copilot and
44:06 then since I have a charg subscription I
44:08 also have uh codex I have subscription
44:11 to cloud code um so technically I could
44:15 use all of them, but we're going to use
44:17 anti-gravity for the simple reason that
44:21 it's free, right? Everyone with a Google
44:23 account can use it. So then um if you
44:26 don't have any of the subscriptions, you
44:28 just download antigravity, which is an
44:30 AI uh assistant from Google.
44:33 You just download anti-gravity and the
44:35 free tier should be enough to do the
44:37 things we need for this course, right?
44:40 uh and at the end I will also share all
44:43 the code we create during the uh
44:45 lessons. So then you can just copy paste
44:47 this code, right? You don't even have to
44:49 have it. But I strongly encourage you to
44:51 try some of the things. You can start
44:52 with anti-gravity because it's free. Uh
44:54 then GitHub copilot has a one month free
44:57 trial. You can try it too. Um cursor is
45:01 called but uh cool but I I cancel it
45:03 because I have all the other things. Uh
45:06 this one as I said if you have JPT plus
45:08 subscription or how it's called you have
45:11 it too, right? So I if you are not using
45:15 them uh I would encourage you to use it.
45:18 If you're using them uh feel free to use
45:20 them in the course.
45:23 Okay. So I think we have last two things
45:27 libraries. So in the course as we go
45:30 through the content you will see a few
45:31 libraries that I implemented myself.
45:34 Right? So these libraries you can see
45:35 the list here. Um the reason I included
45:39 them in the course is either I think
45:41 because they are u beneficial for
45:44 learning purposes. They are lightweight
45:47 alternatives of heavier libraries that
45:50 uh make it more complex. Right? Or
45:52 sometimes there is simply no available
45:55 alternative and I had to implement some
45:56 things myself. Right? So you in this
45:59 page what you will see is all these
46:02 libraries that I implemented that we are
46:04 going to use in the course. I describe
46:06 what this library is doing, what it is
46:08 for, why I implemented this, how it
46:11 works, and what are the alternatives,
46:13 right? Because I understand that u I'm
46:16 just um how to say a solar developer.
46:19 There is no company behind these things.
46:21 So, they might not be necessarily
46:23 production ready. Although some things
46:25 are like minarch, you can use it in
46:27 production use cases. It's fine. uh I
46:30 tested it in many applications outside
46:32 of uh the classroom environment too,
46:36 right? But still like there are
46:38 libraries that are way more mature.
46:40 There are a lot more people behind them.
46:43 So I suggest
46:45 the list of alternatives in case you
46:47 want to be more certain that this
46:50 library that if you're going to
46:52 implement this agents at work, you want
46:54 to be more certain that this library
46:56 works as you expect, right? So um some
47:00 in some cases the library is only for
47:02 learning purposes like this to AI kit
47:05 and just for learning concepts and then
47:06 we switch to another library. So you can
47:10 check it here. I just wanted to add this
47:12 as a disclaimer. So I don't claim these
47:14 libraries to be like production ready
47:16 and I don't necessarily
47:19 want you to use this libraries but I
47:21 found uh that using these libraries were
47:24 quite helpful in teaching some of the
47:27 concepts and showing some of the
47:28 concepts that's why we have these
47:30 libraries here but uh I will also
47:33 clearly show I want to clearly indicate
47:35 okay these are my libraries and these
47:37 are alternatives if you for some reasons
47:39 don't want to use these libraries
47:42 And this week overview is um I think I
47:45 gave it I told you at the beginning. So
47:48 during the week number one we're going
47:51 to build our documentation agent uh or
47:55 sorry documentation rack system agent
47:58 it's going to become an agent in week
48:00 three but now it's just a rack system uh
48:03 for answering questions about this
48:05 evidently AI library.
48:08 So that's it. Uh
48:14 going to go back
48:16 and now um I think we don't have a lot
48:19 of time left but I want to stop sharing
48:22 my screen
48:23 and I want to ask you to like if you
48:26 have any questions um you can use um
48:30 slider link or I think for you it's
48:33 easier just if you just use live chat or
48:37 what you can do is you can just unmute
48:38 yourself and ask your questions.
48:49 If you don't have questions, I have
48:50 questions for you. That's fine.
48:52 >> Uh I have one. Uh considering Hi.
48:55 Considering the amount of like um
48:57 material uh would you recommend some um
49:01 offline like local um
49:05 second brain I system or um how how to
49:09 store our own data like use local rack
49:12 for ourselves.
49:14 >> Okay. Okay. Um so the way I do the way I
49:19 do this the way I approach it when I
49:21 learn something is I use this gold
49:26 good old notes. So I just I watch a
49:28 video and I take notes with my hands
49:33 right with just with a pen. For me it
49:36 works cuz I have to uh pause the video
49:40 or lesson or whatever. I really have to
49:43 focus on learning it right and then I
49:46 also involve my um how is it called I
49:51 don't remember there are different types
49:52 of memories and u when you watch it's
49:56 one type of memory but when you do
49:57 something for example write or create an
50:00 illustration that's another type of
50:01 memory right so that's why I do this cuz
50:03 it engages multiple types of memory for
50:05 me and then um sometimes I don't do
50:09 anything with this sometimes I
50:11 digitalize it. So I turn it into a small
50:13 article for that. I just have a file
50:17 system project. It's um I think it's
50:19 called obsidian the the system.
50:22 >> Yeah, I was going to ask you if
50:25 >> I don't I don't use obsidian but the
50:27 ideas from there, right? So the idea
50:29 there is you have some folder with raw
50:32 idea coming in. Uh then you have some
50:35 folder there with ideas that are already
50:37 polished. And this is what I use for um
50:41 when I learn something when I try new
50:43 things I try to document what I learn
50:47 and uh based on this documentation then
50:49 I publish this and I publish I turn this
50:51 into articles that I publish right you
50:54 don't have to publish so I write for a
50:57 newsletter I write on social media um so
51:01 this is where I have my second brain
51:03 right and um GitHub is my second brain
51:06 but for you it can be just a folder in
51:09 your file system that I I would
51:11 recommend to actually uh use version
51:13 control, put it to GitHub, too. But it's
51:16 up to you, right? That's basically it.
51:18 Take notes, then turn notes into uh
51:21 markdown documents and do whatever you
51:24 want with this. Another thing I do, and
51:26 this is fairly recent, is I implemented
51:29 a bot um that can turn my uh waste
51:33 nodes. So I have a chat in telegram a
51:36 bot and this bot when I send it a voice
51:39 note it turns this voice note it
51:41 transcribes it and then it uses a
51:44 similar system to obsidian
51:47 uh it puts them into / row and then I
51:50 have an agent that uh looks at all these
51:53 row files and turns them into
51:56 articles right so you can try to
51:58 implement something like that I'm still
52:00 in process of implementing this thing I
52:03 still need to describe how this thing
52:04 works. Uh but this can actually be an
52:08 interesting idea for your capstone
52:10 project if you are interested in these
52:14 sort of things. But yeah, this is what I
52:16 do right now. Uh cuz uh for my
52:18 newsletter, I need to constantly produce
52:19 new content and I'm looking for ways to
52:22 optimize to spend less time doing this.
52:25 So right now the flow I found is I just
52:28 dictate my ideas. I dictate what I do.
52:32 uh and then I let agent to turn this uh
52:35 brain dump into something
52:38 editable. I edit this and I publish it.
52:43 So yeah, but don't forget to like if
52:47 it's just a file system, don't forget to
52:48 put it into Git.
52:52 Yes, thanks. For now, I'm using Obsidian
52:55 with backup across multiple devices and
52:58 uh that's cool. Google Drive.
53:02 >> Okay.
53:04 >> Yeah. Also, I used Notion, but now I run
53:06 out of free cells in notion. I cannot
53:08 edit. I cannot add more stuff to my
53:11 notion. So, I need to find an
53:13 alternative.
53:14 >> Maybe I should take a look at Obsidian.
53:17 >> Notion is famous now for being deleting
53:21 content on their own decision. So, if
53:23 it's prohibit their politics, they can
53:25 wipe entirely your collection.
53:29 Yeah, I shoot my gra.
53:44 Um, okay. So, I have a question for you
53:46 like if you're interested in answering.
53:49 I am just wondering um if you already
53:53 have some ideas of what you want to do
53:55 after the course like when you joined
53:58 the course you wanted to probably build
54:01 something right do you already have some
54:04 concrete ideas of what that might be and
54:07 if yes I would be really interested in
54:09 learning about that.
54:18 I mean I have one but uh it's it started
54:21 as swipe coded application and now uh I
54:24 need to move from base 44 it's like
54:26 lovable analog to fully controlled with
54:29 fast API and uh
54:32 local uh agents like for preparing to
54:37 more scalable. So it's basically from uh
54:40 inspired by a bit my wife needs. Uh we
54:44 have like a lot of uh different uh
54:48 tastes in family and uh some of us has
54:51 allergy. So uh it's kind of optimizer
54:55 for uh minimum time for cooking uh
55:00 minimum time for committing to grocery
55:02 shops and uh within uh the same time it
55:06 should maintain the most um healthy like
55:10 nutrients rich uh for different family
55:13 members is different task either it's
55:16 like weight loss or it's like actively
55:19 growing kid like I I just take my own
55:22 task my family and trying to to work on
55:24 it.
55:26 >> Okay, that's pretty interesting. Thanks
55:28 for sharing.
55:30 >> Can I share my thoughts about this?
55:33 >> Yeah, of course.
55:34 uh uh you know uh as a data scientist um
55:38 I've been working in forecasting time
55:41 series forecasting for a while and
55:44 hopefully we reached to a point that we
55:46 can just uh create a software and just
55:51 uh using within different businesses. So
55:56 my dream is to just create an AI agent
56:00 beside this software to just
56:02 specifically be used for any type of
56:05 business individuals or other
56:07 practitioners to get some insight to
56:09 just um simplify things understanding
56:13 analyze the data or make it some
56:16 adaptive to the new environments and
56:19 people. I hope uh this actually targets
56:23 some goal could be achieved through this
56:26 course. I try to do my best to uh fully
56:31 learn this course and I I I definitely
56:34 know that you would very good supportive
56:37 in this case and uh yes that's from
56:40 myself.
56:41 >> Yeah, that's pretty cool. Uh yeah, we
56:43 run out of time. So maybe we can
56:45 continue this discussion uh next time.
56:49 But um I wanted to ask you something. So
56:52 I wanted to take a picture of us. Um and
56:56 if you would be fine with that, uh can
56:59 you please turn on your camera? Right?
57:01 If you don't want and you don't need to
57:03 do this, but I just want to to take a
57:05 picture of uh all of us uh and then I
57:08 will share it on social media. So, of
57:11 course, if you are you don't like that,
57:13 uh don't turn on your camera. Well, I
57:17 see a lot of uh friendly faces. Hi,
57:19 everyone. Very nice to see you. And I'm
57:23 going to
57:25 uh guess Mitri and Galo. Don't want to
57:29 do this one. It's fine. So, I'm going to
57:31 count to three.
57:32 >> Sorry, I'm just in a dark room. It's
57:34 going to be really like a shitty
57:36 picture.
57:37 >> That's fine.
57:38 >> But I'm mentally with you.
57:40 Okay, thank you. Okay. Uh, so I'm going
57:43 to count to three and then I'm going to
57:45 take a picture. So, one, two, three.
57:54 Okay,
57:58 amazing. So, thanks everyone. It was
58:01 really cool to have you all here today.
58:04 Um, I hope you enjoyed this. uh and I'm
58:08 really excited about um this session uh
58:12 this cohort. So um right now not all the
58:16 materials are recorded. I'm actively
58:18 working on that but feel free to check
58:20 old stuff. The text content is in many
58:23 cases is already there and once I add a
58:27 bunch of new videos I'm going to use
58:28 announcements so you will know that okay
58:31 now videos for these lessons are
58:32 available you can go and check. Okay
58:35 thanks a lot. Thanks everyone and um
58:37 happy to see you all here and um yeah
58:41 see you next week and have fun this week
58:43 learning new stuff. So bye everyone. See
58:46 you. Thanks. See you.
