From the physical standpoint we cannot say that the change in the velocity for each increment of s is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) ft. per sec. at all times without certainty; this is known as a change from 0 to 5 ft, the average rate of change of velocity over these four seconds is 0.5 ft/sec. Supposing the change of velocity to be continuous over the period, the value of \\( v \\) as generally obtained would be the actual rate of change of velocity at the instant, which is not taken in the problem considered."
