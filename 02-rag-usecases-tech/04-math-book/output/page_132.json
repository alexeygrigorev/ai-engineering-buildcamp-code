The process of integration in this sense may be conceived as summation or a totaling, whereas the differentiation is rather the process of taking differences. The fundamental concept of integral calculus is what integration suggests addition; differentiation deals with rates of change, while integration considers the totality of the amount, once the determination of change has been made. Integration, in fact, serves to compensate for differentiation. Let us consider the totality of function as a series of changes that tend toward integration."
