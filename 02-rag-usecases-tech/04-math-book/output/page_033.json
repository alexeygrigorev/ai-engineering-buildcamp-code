        "text": "To draw the slope curve we first divide the base in such a way that the points of the curve constructed are as nearly as possible in the same inclination to the vertical, or such that the curve and the curve are approximately straight lines. Thus, in the figure, there is no need to draw the slope between a and b, or c and d. There is no need to draw the curve in the points of section where the slope changes; thus the intersections with the primitive curve are all that is required. Next a point B is chosen, an horizontal unit to the left. And through the line B I draw parallel to the points of section A. A horizontal B I is cut in r at the point of curve a and b, and is a point on the slope of curve OAB."
