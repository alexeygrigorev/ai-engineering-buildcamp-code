Here by drawing tangents to the space-time curve at various points and calculating the slopes, a set of values of the velocity is obtained: these values are then plotted to a base of time and a new curve is drawn, which gives by its ordinate the value of the velocity at any time and is known as the \"velocity-time\" curve."

Hence the derived curve, which is the acceleration-time curve, is a horizontal line, constant and equal to zero. There are first derivatives of the original curve, and second derive curvature or the acceleration."
