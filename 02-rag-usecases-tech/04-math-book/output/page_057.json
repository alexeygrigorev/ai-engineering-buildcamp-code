Referring to Fig. 10, consider a section of the beam at distance from the fixed end. To the right of this section there is a length \\( L \\) attached to a load with tension \\( T \\) on that side; the total load or net downward force on this section is \\[ -T = -2 \\sigma \\] ; and since this load is evenly distributed, it may all be supposed to be concentrated at distance \\( \\frac{1}{2}L \\) from the section."
