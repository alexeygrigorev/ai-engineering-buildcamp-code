Many of the processes described herein depend upon rules explained in the former volume; and accordingly it is suggested that, before commencing to read this work, special attention should first be paid to Part I, pp. 452-460, 463-467, 469-472, and pp. 273-299; whilst a knowledge of the forms of the curves plotted in Chapter IX should certainly prove of great assistance."
