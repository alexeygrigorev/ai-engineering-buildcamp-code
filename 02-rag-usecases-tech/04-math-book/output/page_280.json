With centre O and any convenient radius R describe a semicircle; also let the polar diagram be as shown (the curve OPQMC). The greatest candle power is then given by OC; draw a perpendicular N to the circumference of the semicircle, and make AB OC. Through A and B draw verticals and through A draw a number of rays O1, O2, O3, etc., marking through the lines distancing points the angles a1, a2, a3, etc., from the vertical to the source of light."
