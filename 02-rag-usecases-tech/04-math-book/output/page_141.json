Thus, the reactions are as follows:  Let us designate AB, in other words, marking off a length AC to represent the force at A, where A would be horizontal, and this is the shear base line for the curve of the shearing force and bending moment. The following diagrams on this page give the shear at the point in terms of the distance from where it is drawn."
