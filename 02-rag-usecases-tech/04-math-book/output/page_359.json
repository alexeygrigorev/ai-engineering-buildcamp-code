It states that any periodic function can be expressed as the sum of sine and cosine functions with different amplitudes, phases and periods. Thus, however irregular the curve representing the function may be, so long as it is periodic, it can be reconstructed entirely by a series of sine and cosine terms. In this section, we will explore how these are mathematically defined and what is meant by the terms harmonic analysis."
