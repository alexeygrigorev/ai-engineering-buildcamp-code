In other words, if we had placed a straight edge to be tangential in all positions to the primitive curve, the turning must have been reached, after which the rotation would be in the reverse direction. A point on the curve at which the gradient ceases to rise and begins to fall is called a point of contamination, while the turning in the opposite direction is called a point of inflection."
