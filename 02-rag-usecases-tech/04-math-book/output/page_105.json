By far the most important and interesting direction in which differentiation proves of great service is in the solution of problems concerned with maximum and minimum values; and with these problems we shall now deal."

If the total resistance of the arrangement is \\( R \\), then the current will divide in inverse ratio to the individual resistances and the use of the notation \\( R_{1}, R_{2}, \\ldots R_{n} \\) will represent the individual resistances."
