The initial change must again be related to the change in the small periods of time ${\\Delta}t$. For example, if the average acceleration was 26, if ${\\Delta }t$ = 26 units per sec. sec. and the velocity at the end of the period was 29 units per sec., the change must of course be 3 units in 1 sec."
