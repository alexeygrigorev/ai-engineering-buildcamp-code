Find the moment of inertia of the ring about this axis. (Hint: Compute the polar moment I_p, i.e., the moments about the given axis of an annulus made by a section at right angles to this axis, finding an expression for the inner and outer radii of the annulus, in terms of the distance from the central annulus, and then sum up.)"
