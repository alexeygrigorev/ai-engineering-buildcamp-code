Two such curves are plotted in Fig. 140, and the equation of the curve will be written in terms of the value of the parameter $h$. The first curve, as the second curve, is a bell-shaped curve that is noted on comparing the curves for the smaller value of $h$, i.e., the best probability of the occurrence of the value $x = 2$ would be more nearly correct than for which $h = 5$.\n\n\n\nIt will be seen that the curve is in agreement with the axioms stated on p. 372; for the probability of error is very small, and there is a much higher probability of the interval of -2.3 < x < 2.3 than for the area ABCD in the curve, and ABCD not being presented."
