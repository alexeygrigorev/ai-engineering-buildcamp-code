Whilst the expression $y = f(g(x))$ is essentially a function of $x$, it can be regarded as a function of $g(x)$, and it is observed that $y$ is a function of a function of $x$. This means if $g = h(x)$, then if $y$ is written in terms of $x$, thus: $y = f(h(x))$, then $y$ is a function of $h$, which again, is a function of $x$, since $g = h(x)$. To differentiate a function in this situation the following rule is employed:"
