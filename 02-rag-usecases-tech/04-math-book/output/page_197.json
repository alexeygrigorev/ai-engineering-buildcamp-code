In the simplest electrical engineering theory, we will take the electrical and electromagnetic force at various intervals during the passage of the current, then the mean rate of working is the mean value of the product."

However, a curve is drawn from this mean value that is determined by the mean length of the diameter, which is the area divided by the length of the base. This really amounts to the taking of an average over a large number of ordinates and calculating their average."
