First, the method of uniform volume represented by rectangles must be derived from a consideration of the scales of various quantities. Also, the numerical representation of these areas must be accurately specified; for example, if $l$ represents $1 \text{ sq. in.}$ and $A$ represents the area representing cubic feet of volume. To take a numeric example: let $l = 15 \text{ ft.}$ length, and $r = 5 \text{ ft.}$ radius."
