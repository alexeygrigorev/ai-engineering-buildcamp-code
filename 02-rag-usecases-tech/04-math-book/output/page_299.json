According to the preceding case we might suppose that the solution was \n\n$$y = A e^{\\lambda_1 x} + B e^{\\lambda_2 x}$$ \n\nThis, however, is not the complete solution, which is \n\n$$\\lambda = A \\exp(B x) + C \\exp(\\text{[UNRECOGNIZED TEXT]})$$ \n\nThis means that \\( \\lambda_1 \\) is the square root of a negative quantity, i.e., it is an imaginary. \n\nNow, \\( \\lambda_1 = -a - \\sqrt{-1} \\text{[UNRECOGNIZED TEXT]} = \\delta \\) being positive; hence \n\n$$\\lambda_1 = -a + \\sqrt{-1 - \\sqrt{-a^2}}$$ \n\nYou might have made the solution to Case (i), adopting these values of \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) but this does not prove the most convenient form in which to write the solution. \n\nLet \\( z = \\sqrt{-b}$$"
