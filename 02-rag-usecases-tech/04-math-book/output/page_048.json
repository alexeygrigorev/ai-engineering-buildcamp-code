The curves $y = 5x^2$ and $y = 5x^2 + 17$ are seen plotted in Fig. 8, and an examination shows that the lower curve is the former moved vertically an amount equal to 17 vertical units. Thus, their slopes at corresponding points are the same and consequently, their slopes at corresponding points are the same."
