The correct result is usually found by combining the mean of the observations with the \"probable error of the mean.\" The rough rule that is to follow is to consider primarily the probabilities of the individual observations."

It is important to note the significance of the phrase \"considered over a great range.\" We could not simply assert that we might expect it to happen, say, 50 times out of 120. If, however, we were to use this reasoning and suggest that large numbers might result in apparently \"freaks\" we would eliminate."
