This is done by considering a small element of the section at a distance from the axis of rotation, and then integrating to find the sum of all such elements. The moment of inertia for the entire section can be determined from the relation $I = \\int r^2 \\, dA$ (for area) or $I = \\int r^2 \\, dm$ (for solid); there are two areas or mass of elements."
