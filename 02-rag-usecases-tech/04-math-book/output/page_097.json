Rates of change found through this plan are spoken of as partial rates of change, or more usually partial derivatives, and the process of determining them is known as partial differentiation."

The three co-ordinate axes will be mutually at right angles to each other in the plane of the paper, and the other at right angles to it. If $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the variables, we can say that it is a function of $x$ and $y$, or in the abbreviated form $z = f(x, y)$. "
