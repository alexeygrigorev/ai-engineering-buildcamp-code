The term Centroid has been applied in place of C. G. when dealing with areas; and our work here is more confined towards areas where it will be convenient to adopt the term centroid."

Thus, movements of complex systems of weights may be reduced to the movement of a single weight at the centroid. Therefore, to find the centroid of an area, it is necessary to find the position of the centroid of the bending moment."
