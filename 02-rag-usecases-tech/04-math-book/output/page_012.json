        "text": "Applied Mechanics, Applied Electricity and Hydraulics, provides further illustration of the need of a sound knowledge of the subject to the engineer desirous of equipping himself at all points.\n\nThe latest chapters contain much of interest to the surveyor, the examples chosen being those which are likely to arise in his practice; and particular attention is directed to the investigation leading to the corrections following observations.\n\nThe Author greatly desires to thank the inspirer of this work, the late Mr. W. J. Lineham, B.Sc., M.I.C.E., for his untiring help; to his enthusiasm for his ideals in education, and for his many personal enrichments to the Author, tribute is here paid. Sincere thanks are also tendered to Messrs. J. L. Bale and C. Clapham, B.Sc., for much valuable assistance.\n\nThe greatest care has been taken to produce the book free from errors, but much new matter remains to be presented, and there will be the same early reminder, notification of which will be esteemed a great favour.\n\n       W. N. ROSE.\n\nBorough Polytechnic Institute,  \n  S.B. I.,  \n December, 1919."
