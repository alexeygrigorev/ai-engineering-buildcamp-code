For example, we wish to determine the area of the surface spun out by a small portion at the curve. Let $y = f(x)$ be the given function. To find the area of the surface generated by revolving the path between the limits $x$ and $x + \text{ds}$ around the x-axis, we remember that to each element $y = f(x)$ corresponds a length $L= \text{ds}$ given by."
