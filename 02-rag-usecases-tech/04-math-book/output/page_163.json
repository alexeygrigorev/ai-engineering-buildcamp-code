This is particularly true in cases where the integrals, at times intricate to perform, so that it is very frequently the better plan to resort to a somewhat more elaborated method, despite having to incur the extra labor. However, other methods of integration have to be introduced, keeping in mind that only under very special circumstances do these methods supply the appropriate answers."

It should be remembered, it is well known that the various types should be considered, but this also entails broadening the scope of the standard forms which can vary to each range, and to leave them to suggest further forms."

Thus if we are asked to integrate, with respect to x, the fraction \\[ \\frac{30}{2x^{2}-15x+28} \\], we soon discover that we are unable to perform this operation with our method presented in the previous chapter."
