The thin strip on one side of the original contour from which area may be, and the side of the original contour from which area may be, and the side of the original contour from which area may be, and the side of the original contour from which area may be, that were drawn perpendicular to the line about which there is discussion.\n\nConsider PQR as the reference of a thin strip (such as the one indicated).
