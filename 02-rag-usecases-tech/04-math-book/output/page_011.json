        "text": "From the actual reasoning required for comprehension of such ideas as that of \"limiting values\", the practical mind is often relieved to the applications of differentiation involved in Chapter IV, wherein the legislative of maximum and minimum values making the efficient use of a form. In view of this kind of problem, a special chapter is presented, in which the scope of method of solution has been indicated."

        "text": "Chapters V and VI contain the results to the integration of functions occurring in engineering and related fields, making clear the connection between differentiation and integration. The chance of solving mistakes is avoided, and the combination of graphs allows students to understand the geometric implications."

        "text": "Differential equations occur so frequently that the methods of solution demand special study. Chapter IX presents the most recent results, and the selection of examples based upon these, both worked out and theoretical, is deemed necessary for a proper appreciation of the method of solution."
